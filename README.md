# Doing Websearch using Lucene and Jsoup

# Usage
* Make sure to import Lucene and Jsoup
* Start the programm and do as promted ("Enter query" etc.)
* Have fun searching the web for stuff :)

## Classes
* The Class "Websearch" only contains public static void main
* "Crawler" is used to do the actual crawling and indexing
* QueryEngine contains functions to perform a simple query for the specified index file

## Notes
The commented code in the Crawler works and it does not use Jsoup for downloading the Websites, doing so with Jsoup is a great deal cleaner and better.
